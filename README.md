## Overview
This code defines a module called game that contains a game called "Guess the Number". In this game, the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess the number. The game will provide feedback to the player if the guess is too high or too low. Once the player correctly guesses the number, the game will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

## Usage
To use this code, simply import the modulepar module into your project and call the guessTheNumber() function within the game module. The guessTheNumber() function will run the "Guess the Number" game and return the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

## Note: This code is designed to be run in a testing environment, hence the testexecution and main keywords used in the code.

## Code Structure
This code is divided into two parts: modulepar and game. The modulepar module is responsible for configuring the display system to use the console for output. The game module defines the game logic, including the generateRandomNumber() and playGame() functions. The playGame() function contains the main logic of the game and the guessTheNumber() function is a test case that runs the game and verifies that the correct number of attempts is returned.
